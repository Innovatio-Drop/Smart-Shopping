### Smart-Shopping

#### Abstract :
A shopping mall is a place where people get their daily necessities. People purchase different items and put them on a trolley. After completion of purchases, one needs to go to the billing counter for payments. At the billing counter, the cashier prepares the bill using a barcode reader, which is a time-consuming procedure and results in a long queue at the billing counter. There are demands for quick and easy payment of bills in shopping malls. To overcome these problems, we have designed an intelligent basket. Smart Basket can be an innovation in a small factor that would save the customer's time instead of standing in a line waiting at the billing counter. With correct cooperation from shopping organizations and every mall, we can make this an easy and safe product. We can have two business models 1. To make a patent and sell it to the people who require it the most 2. We can sell this to companies like Reliance Smart Mart or Dmart. The Automated Shopping Trolley is a Smart Trolley that integrates with Barcode Scanners and Raspberry Pi. The scanned item’s data will automatically fetch to a database, we can generate bills for items purchased. The weighing sensor will check the items' weight sent to the database. These modules are integrated into an embedded system and tested to satisfy the functionality.
